    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Our hero Ball has finally arrived at the fabled staircase -- according to the legends, it is one of the final challenges standing between him and riches beyond his wildest dreams. He looks up and notices just how tall the staircase is. After hesitating for just a moment, our hero starts his journey with perhaps a <i>bit</i> too much confidence. After bouncing up a few stairs rather quickly, he pays the price for his hubris and collides against a stair, sending him flying back to where he started. Undeterred, he approaches the staircase once more and prepares to make a powerful and calculated leap. He uses his forward momentum to carry himself up the stairs, more slowly and deliberately before. He is almost at the summit when he realizes his lungs are burning as a result of his incredible effort. As he rests, he notices that an easier option was right next to him the whole time: a ramp. If that late realization was not frustrating enough for our poor hero, he finds himself just in time to watch his rival explorer Ballete rolling up the summit. Exasperated, Ball fully deflates.

    <h2>Disney Principles:</h2>
    As part of this project, I tried to employ as many of the Disney principles of animation as I could.

    <ul>
        <li>I also followed the guidance of the arc principle. When the ball jumps up the stairs, it follows a clear arc -- it would be blatantly obvious if it went in a straight line toward the summit of its jump. Instead, the ball's position was keyframed to angle around that point as if the ball were fighting against gravity. I also added stretch distortions facing the direction the ball was jumping. I would also like to mention here that I used the stretch distortions very carefully -- they are at their longest when they are nearest to the ground, and the ball stretches more when it falls from a higher place.</li>
        <li>As mentioned, I also used followed the "Squash and Stretch" principle. The ball stretches and squashes when getting ready to jump, land, and to highlight the speed at which it is moving. I also employed it to give the ball some character, having the ball look up at the staircase at the beginning of my animation, catch its breath near the top of the stairs, and squash to show its disappointment at being beaten by Ballette.</li>
        <li>I started making my animation with pose-to-pose. I did the basic key frames for climbing the staircase the first and second time, then added the inbetweens so that the ball would travel in a smooth arc</li>
    </ul>

    While those are some of the most obvious principles employed to me, I followed the guidance of several others:
    <ul>
        <li>I employed anticipation when the ball was getting ready to climb the stairs the second time -- you can tell it is really winding up for a large jump</li>
        <li>I used exaggeration in some parts. I believe it's most noticeable with the stretches that make the ball look much more lively and speedy while it is jumping</li>
        <li>One principle that can easily be seen is "Ease In or Out," which states that animated life should not do every action in constant time. For instance, people don't reach and grab objects in one go: their hands start slowly, then accelerate towards an object, and slow as they get closer to it. I used the graph editor to adjust the ball's transformation curves appropriately. The ball decelerates the closer it gets to the climax of its jump, before speeding up as it goes toward the ground again. However, the curve where the ball meets the floor is a special case: it is fastest when leaving the ground, so I made those curves very sharp.</li>
        <li>I gave my ball some extra personality. From looking around, to looking tired, to looking crushed at the end of the short, Ball feels alive to me</li>
        <li>Staging was particularly difficult, as the scene is very vertical and horizontal. I used camera movement and pose-to-pose blocking early on to ensure the scene looked right</li>
        <li>Finally, I think I gave my Ball some appeal with all of these other principles working together to make him a likeable character, even with the short amount of screentime allotted to him.</li>
    </ul>

    I took screenshots at several points during the creation of this animation:

        This is an example of an animation that would not benefit from pose-to-pose animation.
