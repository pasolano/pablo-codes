This is a quick 100 page simple introduction of the questions philosophy asks - things I've been thinking about all my life. I liked the content and the ideas, many of which I have thought about before, but the way it was written didn't make it a fun read. Long, non-concise, overly-questiony sentences",

He has exactly the same mid 20s questions, the same career-life-relationships worries, the what ifs, and the where am I going, whilst also knowing that he's really doing a fairly good job at life.",

This book has a counterpart movie, and it was the first time I've read the book before watching the movie, and I have to say, the movie was awful. It lost everything that made the book special.",

It is a book that needs a re-read every now and then to remind you that the world is a fairly selfish place, and everyone is optimizing for themselves."

The advice in the book is not bad per se - it advocates working on yourself, your body, your wardrobe, your knowledge. But the idea of *getting* girls was still a major part of the book that really made me realize how cheap that sounds. I've never had such relationships before. They've always been built on months of getting to know each other and that's what I value."
