    <p>Following the Bell is an educational RPG from the perspective of someone migrating for labor who is at risk of being subjected to modern slavery.</p>
    <p>Much of the data used in the game is provided by the <a href="https://www.gfems.org/">Global Fund to End Modern Slavery.</a></p>
    <p>I am the lead developer, with some assistance from <a href="https://www.wm.edu/as/modernlanguages/faculty/vierthaler_p.php">Professor Vierthaler</a>, who helped start this project.</p>
    <p>The other student working on this game who is largely responsible for the artwork and dialogue is <a href="https://www.wm.edu/as/1693scholars/current/gibson_j/index.php">Julia Gibson</a>, who I am very grateful to be working with.</p>
    <p>We hope to have a demo release done by the end of this semester. One demo already went through a round of testing, and I am currently implementing the required fixes.</p>
