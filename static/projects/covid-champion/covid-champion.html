    <p>COVID Champion is a tower defense game that was made for my Game Design course.</p>
    <p>I was the leader of my team of four, and as our leader I would lead our Extreme Programming meetings and write our progress reports.</p>
    <p>Every game in the class had to be done without an engine. We could only use SFML as a general graphics library, and the rest had to be done in pure C++.</p>
    <p>While our game ended up being fairly short, I'm still proud of our product. Many of our team members were new to game design and development, and we were able to create a functional (and fun) game.</p>
    <p>It was definitely interesting to see game programming from such a low-level perspective. I think it definitely helped me appreciate everything engines do for us.</p>
