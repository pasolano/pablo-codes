    <p>I organized a team of 4 people to compete in VTHacks 7. Together, we made SpendGood, an application that helps its users manage their finances in novel ways.

    <p>This app addresses consumers' problems with overspending on certain kinds of products and helps them visualize trends in their spending habits. The application stores users' spending information. It also presents users with an analysis of their past versus current spending, visualizations of their spending habits, and personalized future spending plans.</p>

    <p>My role in making this webapp included working on the app's interaction with the Nessie API and making Python scripts to assist in automating this process. I also created most of the example data our demo relied on.</p>

    <p>We won two awards: "Best Financial Hack by Capital One", and "Best Use of MicroStrategy Embedded Analytics."</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, MicroStrategy only gave us access to their API for the duration of the hackathon, meaning that this can not be used anymore. However, once the competition was over, I added static files to some of the places the API used to be used.</p>

    <p>If you would like to try this project anyway, clone the repository from GitHub and run the <a href="https://github.com/pasolano/spendgood/blob/master/spendgood.py">spendgood.py</a> file.</p>
