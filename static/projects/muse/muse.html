    <p>&mu;SE is a mutation-based soundness evaluation framework which systematically evaluates Android static analysis tools to discover, document, and fix flaws.</p>
    <p>I contributed to this project while I was enrolled in W&M's Software Engineering course, CSCI 435, Fall 2020. My contributions to this project were mostly related setting up and maintaining the integrity of &mu;SE's CI/CD.</p>
    <p>Code belongs to a private repository, but samples may be provided by request.</p>
