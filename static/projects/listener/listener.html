<div>
    <p>This project was made by a team of three for our final presentation at CSSI.</p>
    <p>Users log when they bought items, and how often they need them. The app then reminds the user when it's time to buy the item again.</p>
    <p>The application was built so that a predictive feature (that guesses when the user would next need the product without inputting it manually) could be added without much extra effort.</p>
