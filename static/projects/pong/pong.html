    <p>At the beginning of my game design class, we individually recreated the classic game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Pong</a>.</p>
    <p>We were given the liberty to add elements to the game anywhere we saw fit, so I decided to go for a retro theme, but also have some extra challenges for the players included.</p>
    <p>This mostly came with the speed of the ball and the extra obstacles in the middle of the playing field. This project was much easier than <a href="/projects/covid-champion">COVID Champion</a>, but it was just as fun.</p>
